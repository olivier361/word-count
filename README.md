# word-count
The program takes a text file and will count the frequency of words of different lengths. Different parameters affect the way results are displayed. This is a modified version of an assignment.  The program must be run with command line arguments "./word_count --infile &lt;input_file> --sort --print-words" with sort and print-words being optional.
